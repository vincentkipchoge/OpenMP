# OpenMP
Parallel and Distributed Computing OpenMP implementation practice with matrix multiplication 

Task 1: Write a parallel program using OpenMP based on this sequential solution of matrix multiplication.
Task 2: Write a block-optimized matrix multiplication program and use OpenMP to parallel its

<b>To compile the program with OpenMP, use:</b>
$ gcc program.c -o program.o -fopenmp
